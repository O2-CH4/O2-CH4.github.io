## Inductor Magnetic Energy Estimation Based on a MLP Surrogate Model [(PDF)](https://o2-ch4.github.io/files/Surrogate_Inductor.pdf) 

- **Context**: ML Graduate Course

- **Overview**: Investigate the possibility of using ML/DL methods as fast & accurate surrogate approaches for approximating the exact mapping made by FEA methods on an Electro-Magnetic model for evaluating design parameters of an Inductor. 

- **Details**: Many complex engineering designs requires weeks of computations in order to assess the quality of a certain project design. Those computations often solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in a precise manner via methods similar to Finite-Element-Analysis (FEA). In a simple example, extensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) calculations are necessary to quantify the effectiveness of a plane design (Ex: Evaluating lift, drag, etc.). Therefore, approximating via statistical models the mapping made by the PDEs between some design parameters and the effectiveness metrics of a design could accelerate by many orders of magnitude the design cycles of many engineering project as design evaluation could take seconds instead of weeks. This was the subject of our research project, where we tested the performance of multiple ML models for approximating the Magnetic Energy parameter of an inductor design based on design features like its multi-dimensional topology.

- **Data**: The database of 100â€™000 samples has been provided by one of our team member from Switzerland (professor and researcher), and thus the data is proprietary (only to be used in this project) and owned by iCoSys (Institute of Complex Systems in Fribourg, University of Applied Science of Western Switzerland).

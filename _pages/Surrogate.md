## Inductor Magnetic Energy Estimation Based on a MLP Surrogate Model [(PDF)](https://o2-ch4.github.io/files/Surrogate_Inductor.pdf) 


- **Context**: This project, undertaken as part of a graduate course in machine learning, explored the use of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to create fast and accurate surrogate models for evaluating the magnetic energy of inductor designs. 

- **Overview**: The objective was to approximate the computationally intensive mapping typically performed by Finite Element Analysis (FEA) methods, which are widely used to solve Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) for design evaluation in engineering. By leveraging ML-based surrogate models, the project aimed to significantly reduce the time required for these evaluations, potentially accelerating the design cycle of complex engineering systems from weeks to seconds.

- **Details**: The study focused on inductor designs, with the target metric being their magnetic energy, which depends on multi-dimensional design features, such as topology. To achieve this, we tested the performance of various ML models, including multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), for accurately approximating the FEA mappings. The database used for this research, consisting of 100,000 samples, was proprietary and provided by a Swiss research collaborator from iCoSys (Institute of Complex Systems, Fribourg, University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland).

- **Takeaway**: This project highlighted the potential of ML surrogate models to streamline engineering design processes by offering a practical and efficient alternative to traditional PDE-based computational methods. The approach not only reduces computational costs but also opens possibilities for rapid design iterations and optimization in real-world applications.

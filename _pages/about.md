## 1) Overview 

I am a Canadian AI graduate student completing my second M.Sc. in Computer Science (AI) at the University of Montreal and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en). My research focused on Representation Learning for Deep Reinforcement Learning under the supervision of [Pablo Samuel Castro](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/pablo-samuel-castro). Previously, I was a Research Graduate Intern at [CERVO Brain Research Center](https://cervo.ulaval.ca/en) in [Christian Ethier’s Lab](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=9CzYcbAAAAAJ&hl=en), where I applied deep learning to decode intra-cortical signals for motor BCIs. I am **currently seeking internship** or job opportunities for summer 2025 and beyond.

## 2) Research Interests

**- Sensory Understanding, Reasoning, and Control:**  
• Representation learning from multimodal and high-dimensional data  
• Deep Reinforcement Learning for complex policy learning and control  
• Predictive world modeling, multi-step reasoning, and hierarchical planning  

**- Theoretical Challenges:**  
• Fundamental aspects of learning and intelligence  
• Achieving better sample efficiency and generalization  
• Optimizing target performance under resource constraints  

**- Applied Problems:**  
• AI-enhanced scientific simulations (e.g., CFD/FEA with surrogate models)  
• Robotics learning in complex simulators, sim2real and real2sim challenges  
• End-to-end learning for combinatorial problems (e.g., ressource allocation)  
• AI-driven control for aerospace applications and Brain-Computer Interfaces

## 3) Personal Interests

I enjoy visiting technology, science, and space museums while traveling, having driven over 1.5 times the Earth’s circumference across my last three U.S. road trips for that purpose. I have a broad interest in reading across many subjects and enjoy practicing various physical sports.

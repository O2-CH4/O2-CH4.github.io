## 1) Overview 

I'm a Canadian AI graduate student pursuing my second M.Sc in Computer Science at the University of Montreal and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en). My current research focus is on Representation Learning for Deep Reinforcement Learning, under the guidance of [Pablo Samuel Castro](https://mila.quebec/en/pablo-samuel-castro?page=0%2C%2C0). Before this, I was a Graduate Research Intern at [CERVO Brain Research Center](https://cervo.ulaval.ca/en) in [Ethierâ€™s Lab](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=9CzYcbAAAAAJ&hl=en). There, I was completing my first M.Sc in Computer Science at Laval University, where I applied deep learning techniques to decode intra-cortical signals for motor brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).

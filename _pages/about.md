## 1) Overview 

I am a Canadian AI graduate student finishing my second M.Sc. in Computer Science at the [Mila – Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/ayoub-echchahed). My master’s research focused on representation learning for deep reinforcement learning, advised by [Pablo Samuel Castro](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/pablo-samuel-castro), with whom I co-authored a [survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17518) published in *TMLR*. In parallel, I have collaborated with Aaron Courville, Hugo Larochelle, Juan Duque, and other Mila researchers on multi-agent reinforcement learning in social-dilemma settings, with our [recent work](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ex93RVyP5r) analyzing how opponent-shaping methods can promote cooperation and stability under climate and economic constraints. In the context of my first master’s, I also worked on deep learning for brain–computer interface (BCI) research at the [CERVO Brain Research Center](https://cervo.ulaval.ca/en/), where I developed end-to-end neural decoding pipelines from raw intracortical signals. On the industry side, I recently worked on deep learning and reinforcement learning projects in engineering R&D at Bombardier Aerospace and Bentley Systems, developing predictive models from flight test data and exploring reinforcement learning for automated civil design.

## 3) Personal Interests

I enjoy visiting technology, science, and space museums while traveling, having driven over 1.5 times the Earth’s circumference across my last three U.S. road trips for that purpose. I have a broad interest in reading across many subjects and enjoy practicing various physical sports.

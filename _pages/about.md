## 1) Overview 

I am a Canadian AI graduate student finishing my second M.Sc. in Computer Science at the [Mila – Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en). My master’s research focused on representation learning for deep reinforcement learning with [Pablo Samuel Castro](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/pablo-samuel-castro) as my advisor, with whom I co-authored a [survey of the field published in *TMLR*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.17518).  
Separately from my master’s work, I collaborate with Aaron Courville, Hugo Larochelle, Juan Duque, and other Mila researchers on multi-agent reinforcement learning in social-dilemma settings, for example through opponent-shaping methods. Our first paper, [*Towards Sustainable Investment Policies Informed by Opponent Shaping*](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ex93RVyP5r), analyzes the emergence of cooperation in economic environments under climate risk, using the InvestESG simulator to identify conditions where individual incentives diverge from collective welfare and showing how opponent-aware learning can promote more sustainable equilibria. Earlier this year, I worked in industry applying deep learning and reinforcement learning to engineering R&D at Bombardier Aerospace and Bentley Systems. Before that, as part of my first M.Sc. in Computer Science at Laval University, I was a research intern at the [CERVO Brain Research Center](https://cervo.ulaval.ca/en) in [Christian Éthier’s Lab](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=9CzYcbAAAAAJ&hl=en), where I developed deep learning pipelines for neural decoding in Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) research.

## 3) Personal Interests

I enjoy visiting technology, science, and space museums while traveling, having driven over 1.5 times the Earth’s circumference across my last three U.S. road trips for that purpose. I have a broad interest in reading across many subjects and enjoy practicing various physical sports.

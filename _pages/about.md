## 1) Overview 

I am a Canadian AI graduate student completing my second M.Sc. in Computer Science (AI) at the University of Montreal and the [Mila AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en). My research focuses on Representation Learning for Deep Reinforcement Learning under the supervision of [Pablo Samuel Castro](https://mila.quebec/en/directory/pablo-samuel-castro). Previously, I was a Graduate Research Intern at [CERVO Brain Research Center](https://cervo.ulaval.ca/en) in [Christian Ethier’s Lab](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=9CzYcbAAAAAJ&hl=en), where I applied deep learning to decode intra-cortical signals for motor brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). My first M.Sc., also in Computer Science (AI), was completed at Laval University. I am **currently seeking internship** or job opportunities for summer 2025 and beyond, focusing on meaningful work, regardless of salary expectations.




## 2) Research Interests

- **Sensory Understanding, Reasoning, and Control:**
I am greatly interested in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for the learning of complex control policies from high-dimensional information. This includes developing representation learning methods from past interactions, raw multimodal data (text, images, videos), or noisy sensor streams. I am also particularly interested in multi-step reasoning (e.g., predictive world modeling) and hierarchical control for generating action plans across different time scales, enabling agents and robots to solve downstream tasks efficiently.


- **Theoretical Challenges:**
My interests extend to the theoretical and fundamental aspects of learning/intelligence, notably achieveing greater sample efficiency, or optimizing performance under constrained resource conditions.



- **Applied Domains:**
I am also drawn to applications of ML/DRL in scientific discovery and HPC-driven numerical simulations (e.g., CFD, FEA), such as through surrogate models. In robotics, I find the integration of DRL in complex simulators (e.g., digital twins) promising, where sim-to-real and real-to-sim techniques are critical for reducing reliance on behavioral cloning. More broadly, I am also interested by the end-to-end learning of solvers for combinatorial optimization and operations research problems (e.g., resource allocation), as well as innovative AI applications for control in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and aerospace systems.




## 3) Personal Interests

I enjoy visiting technology, science, and space museums while traveling, having driven over 1.5 times the Earth’s circumference across my last three U.S. road trips for that purpose. I have a broad interest in reading across many subjects and enjoy practicing various physical sports.

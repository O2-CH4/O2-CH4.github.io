## 1) Overview 

I'm a Canadian AI graduate student pursuing my second M.Sc in Computer Science at the University of Montreal and the Mila AI Institute. My research focus is on Representation Learning for Deep Reinforcement Learning, under the guidance of [Dr. Pablo Samuel Castro](https://mila.quebec/en/person/pablo-samuel-castro/). Before this, I was a Graduate Research Intern at [CERVO Brain Research Center](https://cervo.ulaval.ca/en) in [Ethierâ€™s Lab](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=9CzYcbAAAAAJ&hl=en). There, I was completing my first M.Sc in Computer Science (Laval University), where I applied Deep Learning techniques to decode intra-cortical brain signals for motor control BCIs.

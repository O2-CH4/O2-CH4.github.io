## Notebooks on ML Models (Python) & Scientific Computing (Julia): Theory and Code


During the summer of 2021, I created two notebooks:

•	**Machine Learning Models with Python [(PDF)](https://o2-ch4.github.io/files/ML_Notebooks.pdf):** 80-page document summarizing machine learning models with theoretical explanations and Python code implementations. Compiled from 20 books and various papers, it also served as a learning resource for friends.

•	**Scientific Computing with Julia [(PDF)](https://o2-ch4.github.io/files/Julia_Notebooks.pdf):** 27-page document on scientific computing with Julia, covering mathematical modeling, numerical methods for solving equations, and hybrid techniques like PINNs, with practical examples and Julia code implementations.

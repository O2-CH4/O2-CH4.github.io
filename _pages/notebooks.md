## Notebooks on ML Models (Python) & Scientific Computing (Julia): Theory and Code


During the summer of 2021, I created two notebooks:

•	Scientific Computing with Julia (27 pages) [(PDF)](https://o2-ch4.github.io/files/Julia_Notebooks.pdf): 
27-page document on scientific computing with Julia, covering mathematical modeling, numerical methods (ODEs, PDEs, SDEs), and hybrid techniques like PINNs, with practical examples and Julia code implementations


•	Machine Learning Models with Python [(PDF)](https://o2-ch4.github.io/files/ML_Notebooks.pdf):
80-page document summarizing machine learning models with theoretical explanations and Python code implementations. Compiled from 20 books and various papers, it also served as a learning resource for friends.

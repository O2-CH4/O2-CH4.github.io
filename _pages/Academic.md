I began my academic journey studying Economics and Financial Analysis, initially driven by interests in asset pricing and sophisticated hedge fund strategies. After completing my degree in under three years, I recognized the growing significance of AI through independent study and decided to shift toward computer science. This led me to pursue an M.Sc. in AI at Laval University, where I aimed to work on innovative class projects when possible.

During this time, I collaborated with Dr. Ethier on a unique class project that led to an internship at the CERVO Brain Research Center. My work involved applying deep learning and computer vision to develop an end-to-end pipeline for decoding rodent kinematics information from raw intra-cortical recordings, integrating signal processing, dataset generation, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) training.

To further specialize in AI research, I pursued a second M.Sc. at the Mila AI Institute, focusing on Representation Learning for Deep Reinforcement Learning. As I complete this degree, I am still looking to deepen my knowledge in various areas and explore opportunities in academia or industry, applying AI to practical challenges.

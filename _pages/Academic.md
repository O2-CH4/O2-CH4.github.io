Initially interested in Economics and Financial Analysis (asset pricing, hedge fund strategies), I transitioned to AI after graduating in under three years (2021). During my first M.Sc. at Laval University, I collaborated with Dr. Ethier on a project applying deep learning and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to decode rodent kinematics from intra-cortical neural signals at the CERVO Brain Research Center.

I am now completing my second M.Sc. at the Mila AI Institute, where i specialized myself in Representation Learning for Deep Reinforcement Learning. Through 12 graduate AI courses across my two master’s programs, I’ve established a strong theoretical and practical foundation that enables me to effectively approach diverse AI problems.
